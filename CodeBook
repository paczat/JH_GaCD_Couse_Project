The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and the required analysation and modification described by the course project’s instraction.

   1. Loading required packages and dataset
        Dataset downloaded and extracted to the folder "/Coursera/Data_science_Johns_Hopkins/Getting_and_Cleaning_Data/Week4/DataDir/"

    2. Assign each data to variables
    
        features <- features.txt (561 rows, 2 columns)
            The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
        act_labels <- activity_labels.txt (6 rows, 2 columns)
            List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
            
        subject_test <- /test/subject_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
            Test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects
        X_test <- /test/X_test.txt (2947 rows, 561 columns)
            Test data of recorded features 
        y_test <- /test/y_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 columns)
            Test data of activities’code labels
            
        subject_train <- /train/subject_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
            Train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects
        X_train <- /train/X_train.txt (7352 rows, 561 columns)
            Train data of recorded features 
        y_train <- /train/y_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 columns)
            Train data of activities’code labels

    2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
        
        X_merge (10299 rows, 561 columns):  merged X_train and X_test using rbind() function
        y_merge (10299 rows, 1 column): merged  y_train and y_test using rbind() function
        Subject_merge (10299 rows, 1 column):  merged subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
        Data_merged (10299 rows, 563 column):  merged Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

    3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
        
        Data_tidy (10299 rows, 88 columns):subsetted Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

    4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        
        Entire numbers in code column of the Data_tidy replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

    5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
      
        code column in Data_tidy renamed into respective activities
           Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
           Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
           BodyBody is replaced by Body
           Mag is replaced by Magnitude
           All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
           All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

    6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
        
        Tidy_DataSet (180 rows, 88 columns) is the summarized Data_tidy ( groupped by subject and activity, taking the means of each variable).
        
        Export Tidy_DataSet into Tidy_DataSet.txt
